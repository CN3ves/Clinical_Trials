## Equipoise, IRBs, and HIPAA

### Equipose

In clinical trials, in order to be ethically
justified in randomly allocating participants to the treatment groups,
we need to have a genuine uncertainty regarding
the comparative therapeutic merits of the interventions being studied.
  
  * In theoretical equipoise would imply that the evidence
of benefits of each of the therapies are well balanced.
  * But clinically, we define equipoise as a lack of
consensus within the expert clinical community on the preferred therapy.

So it's possible that individuals within the community may
have an opinion that one treatment is better than the
others, but what we need for clinical equipoise is for
the clinical community as a whole to be in equipoise,
not all the clinicians within the trial.

Before we begin a trial, we have to make some sort of estimate
regarding the difference in treatment effects in
the groups that we plan to study. But we make estimates about the difference in treatment effects,
and these estimates are surrounded by some measure of uncertainty.
If our estimates of uncertainty do not cross the null hypothesis.
And that means that we cannot ethically randomize people
to receive either the new therapy or the control therapy
because enough evidence already exists to make us believe
that the new therapy is better than the control therapy.

If we are not sure that the new therapy is better than
the control therapy, and we still have
some uncertainty (estimate confidence interval crosses the null) about which therapy is better, 
we are in the state of equipoise.

What we find in practice is that not
all therapies show as much promise as we hoped when we were designing the study.
And in fact, we are often quite optimistic
about how efficacious a new therapy will be.
It's also difficult to find a group of investigators
that are all individually in a state of equipoise.
This is why we require that there be
a general state of equipoise in the clinical community.
The investigators who feel strongly one way or the
other are the ones that are the biggest advocates for the trial.

And as trials go on we need a way to reevaluate equipoise during the trial.
And this is called data monitoring.
But this helps us determine if we are still in a state
of equipoise during the trial and whether it's ethical to continue the trial.

### Institutional Review Boards

 * Regulatory law is codified in the [code of
federal regulations][the code of federal regulations] and published in the federal register: 

  * Title 45, part 46, on the protection of human subjects.
And this section applies to any institution that
uses federal funds to conduct research on humans.
If the institution uses any federal funds, then the regulation
applies to all research done at that Institution.

And it says that the institution has the responsibility
for protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects.

And it requires that the research be reviewed and approved by an
institutional review board, or IRB, before the federal funding can be obtained.
So, if you win an award with the NIH, they will not transfer any
money to your institution until you can demonstrate that
your study's been reviewed and approved by your IRB.
The FDA has similar regulations for studies under its purview
and those are codified in title 21, part 50, and title 21, part 56 (21CFR50 and 21CFR56).

### IRB Authority
The federal regulations give IRBs quite a bit of authority.
  * IRBs can approve, require modifications to,
or disapprove of research activities.
  * They have to approve all consent documents,
or they can approve a waiver
of consent when it's not practical to
get consent before participation, such as emergency situations.
  * They are also required by law to conduct
continuing review of research at least once per year.
  * And, during these reviews, they can suspend or terminate the approval
of the research if it is not being
performed in accordance with what was approved by
the IRB, or if they find that there
are unexpected undue risks associated with the treatments.

### Criteria for IRB approval
In order to approve a research application, the IRB has to
determine that all of the criteria on this list are met.
  * They have to determine that the risks to the subjects are minimized and
that they're reasonable in relationship to the anticipated benefits.
  * They have to assure that the selections of subjects is done in
an equitable manner, and that consent is obtained and documented before participation.
  * They have to determine that there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy
and the confidentiality of the participants, and
that there are safeguards for vulnerable populations.
  * And finally the last bullet is not actually mentioned in
any of the ethical codes but is part of the regulation.
The IRB has to review the provisions that are made for data monitoring.

### IRB submission
So submissions to the IRB have to describe
and justify the research question and the rationale.

  * They have to detail the procedures of the research.
Who's going to do the research? Where is it going to be done?
And they have to describe the risks
that might be incurred by taking part in the research.

  * submit protocol

  * Investigators also have to submit their
recruitment procedures and their materials, so the
IRB can determine if the materials
appropriately represent the protocol to the participants.

### Basic elements of Consent
  * The basic elements of consent are also
codified in the Code of Federal Regulations,
and it says that the consenting process and the forms that are used to document
the consent should inform patients of all of these elements.

  * They have to describe the purpose of
the research, including the reasonably foreseeable risks and the benefits.
  * They also have to describe what are the alternative courses
of treatment if you choose not participate in the trial.
  * They have to describe how the records are being kept confidential.
  * And if there is compensation for injury, what is it?
  * They also have to give contact
information for the investigator and for the overseeing IRB.
  * And they have to make it clear that participation in the research
is entirely voluntary, and that the participants can withdraw at any time.

### Privacy
The original purpose of the HIPAA regulation (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996) was
to institute national standards for electronic health care transactions.
And the intent was to improve the efficiency of these transactions.
But it was recognized that this was
referring to people's private data, and it was felt that it was important to put
into law some guidance as to how the privacy of the data should be protected.

And entities are required to follow HIPAA if
they engage in any electronic transfer of health information.
So this applies to the transfer of information in healthcare provider
settings, but it also has implications for research settings, since investigators
are also involved in the use and transfer of people's private medical data.

### HIPPA and clinical Trials
In clinical trials, we use data in several different forms, and
we have to describe who is allowed to see different sorts
of data in either the consent form or a HIPAA form
that is also signed by the participant before they begin the study.
  * And the use of raw data is actually fairly limited, and by raw data I mean
data that includes personally identifying information, such
as name or social security number, or
date of birth, or other identification that could be directly linked to a person.
And in clinical trials, only auditors usually see this sort of data, in
addition to the study staff at the clinical center that collect the data.
So people auditing from the IRB, the study
sponsor, be it NIH or a pharmaceutical company, the FDA, or even someone
auditing from the coordinating center, might see
the raw data at the clinical center.

  * But what's usually written on the data collection forms and what's
recorded in the database does not have personally identifying data on it.
Instead, it's identified by a study code.
So each participant, instead of recording in the
database their name, we record a code such as AB004.
And that code is used to identify that person on all their data collection forms.
And a much broader group of people may see the coded data.
The coordinating center collects and manipulates the coded data.
The IRBs, the FDA, and the sponsors may see the coded data.
The data monitoring,
the data monitoring committees see coded data, and
also collaborators from different sites may see coded data.

  * In addition federally sponsored research has requirements that data be
shared and made publicly available after the conclusion of the trial.

So data is also seen in other forms, such as the
de-identified data sets and limited use data sets, and these both make
a much wider umbrella of people who may see coded data.
De-identified data sets are those which, as much
as possible, all potentially identifying information has been removed.
And this is extremely restrictive.
It includes all dates, including date of birth, date of death, date of diagnosis,
all dates of study visits and it's
extremely difficult to do, and it makes the
resulting data sets of limited use.
There are also data sets called limited use data sets, that have the
obvious personal identifies removed, and can only
be used with a data use agreement.
So investigators have to receive IRB approval to use the data
set, and then they have to sign an agreement saying that
they will not share the data with other people, and that
they will not try to identify the people in the data set.
 
## Contemporary Ethical Issues

### Selection ofcontrol therapy
An ongoing controversy in clinical trials is what to select as the control therapy.

  * The placebo orthodoxy is that placebo should be used unless there is an increased risk of serious harm. Meaning death or irreversible morbidity, in the absence of a therapy.

And the argument for this is that without a placebo, the finding of no difference between a new and standard therapy
is difficult to interpret and can be misleading. In addition because we are expecting to see a bigger difference between a placebo experimental treatment than we would see between an active control and in experimental treatment.
Placebo designs are more efficient in determining efficacy meaning that they require fewer people.
Another argument for using the placebo is that the standard of car is not universal.

  * The act of control orthadoxy says that if an effective therapy exists, the use of placebo should be prohibited.

And the argument for this orthodoxy is that the clinically relevant question is not whether
a new therapy is better than nothing. Which is the placebo. But whether the new therapy is better than the standard treatment.
But, again, the problem is if you find no difference between the experimental treatment and the active control, the interpretation of the results can be difficult because you don't know whether either treatment is better than nothing in the current setting. 

### Non-uniforme standard of care
As I mentioned, the standard of care is not uniform. It differs greatly between countries and there's particularly
a big gap between developed and developi ng countries and even within a country there can be a lot of variability in the standard of care.

An example of where this caused a controversy
was in the prevention of maternal tranmission of HIV. In developed countries, a high dose of oral AZT in late pregnancy, and IV AZT during birth was considered the standard of care. But in developing countries, there was no therapy because the AZT
therapy required a lot of infrastructure and was very expensive to provide. So, in this setting, investigators wanted to be able to provide a treatment regimen that was more practical to deliver in developing countries.
For example, a low dose oral therapy. And the question was, should a trial of the low dose oral therapy proposed for use in a developing country be compared to the high dose AZT therapy, which was standard of care in the developed world.
Or to a placebo, because the standard of care in the developing world was no therapy.

### Globalisation of research
Clinical trials are occurring increasingly on a more global scale.
In an article published in the New England
Journal in 2009, the authors pulled trials from clinicaltrials.gov
which is a site that registers clinical trials.
And they looked at industry sponsored phase
three trials and found that industry sponsored trials
and the 20 largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies
were being done increasingly outside of the U.S..
They found that more than a 3rd of the trials recruited solely outside of the
U.S. And the majority of the clinical sites were outside of the U.S.

And they thought that this was the because in the developing world, there
is a large pool of untapped participants,
and that there is substantial cost savings.
Medical care in many developing countries costs only a
fraction of what it costs in the United States.
And the bureaucracy and regulatory environments
are much more complicated in wealthy nations.

### Benefits/Concerns
This globalization of research has some benefits,
but also is a cause for some concern.
 
  * Doing research around the world helps to build global collaborations.
  * And it also helps to make the results more generalizable, because we are answering questions that are of interest throughout the world.

But ethically and practically there are some concerns as well.
  * The regulatory bodies that are used in monitoring trials are used to what is requred in their domestic markets. And they may have limited knowledge of procedures in people in other markets.
  * The financial compensation for participation may be large in a clinical trial with
respect to what people make in their regular wages and this could be coercive.
  * And participation in a trial may be the only way that some of the people would have access to adequate healthcare for their condition
  * The local standards of care may be lower than what is required in the developed world. And it may lead to research that would not be permissible in wealthier countries.
  * And finally, research should be applicable to the needs and priorities of the community in which it's being conducted.
  So that the results will be useful in that setting.
