# Randomization

## Rationale for Randomization

Randomization is a key feature
of the experimental design that a clinical trial is based on.
So there are other features that are indeed
as important as randomization and they include things
like standardized treatment and having a prospective plan
for data collection, adverse event reporting, as well
as the regulatory requirements that go along with clinical trials.
And these features tend to distinguish clinical trials from other types
of observational studies and even from non randomized studies in some cases.

So, it's important to recognize that the concept of randomization, or the drawing
of lots, has been with us throughout history. It, it is the idea of drawing a lot as a
way to ensure that the benefits and risk of an activity or event are
equally shared or fairly shared across a group of people is a very early concept.
One that's well illustrated with the concept of a military draft.
Where the risk of war is shared across the population
by drafting men mostly, into military service by the mechanism of a lottery.
So this concept, which has been used in many areas,
including how to divide some scarce resource up, or the concept
of drawing the short straw. 

* So just by way of background, many times we talk about or use the word random in,
in our usual speech, And what we mean by that is something that's not
predictable and seems to be haphazard and there's no causal relationship
that can be identified between things.
* But in the context of a clinical trial,
we have a much more rigorous definition of random.
And what it means is that the process, a random process is
one in which there is associated with every legitimate outcome a probability.
So there's a legitimate probability associated with whether
you'll be assigned to treatment A or treatment B.
Such as with every coin toss, we assume if it's
a fair coin there's a 50/50 chance of heads or tails.
With dice throws there's a one in six chance
of any particular side of the die coming up.
And this is a much more rigorous definition than
the lay definition. 


### Historical context 
We first see the idea of randomization to be used in a medical setting in the
17th century. Van Helmont proposed that people be randomly divided
or divided by lots to determine their treatment because he wanted to evaluate
his form of care against more standard forms of care
of the day, which included bloodletting and other potentially harmful interventions.
And so he proposed that a number of patients be divided, and that at the
end the half that are treated by him, according to his procedures, be compared to the other half of the patients that were treated with other procedures. And then there'd be, there'll be a count of how many people had died in order to evaluate bloodletting in healthcare.


The idea of randomization was first
introduced formally into experimental design by Ronald Fisher.
And the question that Fisher was trying to address
was to how to allocate plots of soil in agricultural
settings to different treatments. There was no question about whether there
needed to be controls on the comparison of the different treatments on plots.
It was just a matter of, of how the plots were to be allocated because you can
imagine that even within a field there's differences in sunlight and drainage.
And they wanted to have a method of fairly
distributing those effects among the treatments.
And so what he proposed was to use random allocation, in the allocation of lots.
* Because he said by doing this it was the most efficient and unbiased way to estimate the measurement error, error associated with a particular treatment. 
* And he proposed that any other way of doing this would either over estimate or under
estimate the kind of random error associated with how the yield was in a particular plot.
* He also noted that there was some safeguard against non-normality in the outcome data, which was an added benefit of using randomization.
So note that his arguments about the use of randomization are all kind of based on
its statistical properties for estimating measurement error, and
that it's the most efficient way to do an experiment.
And, there's not a lot of emphasis in his work about the use of controls.

The person who really is responsible for introducing randomization to medical
science, is Sir Austin Bradford Hill. He was from an epidemiological
background and his concern was about confounding
that was associated with the type of people that got a particular treatment.
Because he noted that people actually were quite variable
in how they may react or respond to a treatment.
And there can be in some ways predicted, and some of it's
unpredictable, was a problem in estimating treatment effects.
And because of the idea of a selection bias associated
with treatment assignment, that the prognosis for the disease would be
somehow be related to what treatment a patient was given.
Commonly referred to as confounding by indication.
So that people are given treatments based on their own unique characteristics.
And what Bradford Hill was suggesting, is to get rid of that problem of
the selection bias, in which people get
which treatments, that random allocation be used.
So the critics of a clinical trial would be unable to
say that the groups were not equal at the start,
that they were somehow biased based on the physician
and caretaker's opinion about what treatment the patient should get.
Perhaps, you can think of it in some senses that they might give the
sickest patients the new treatment because they
hadn't responded to older treatments and were
in more dire need of a new option.
And someone who was promoting a treatment had a interest in the treatment
might do exactly the opposite and want the new treatment to look good.
And so only give it to the best candidates.
So Bradford Hill was very concerned about these type of biases and
he proposed that randomization be introduced
to clinical trials to eliminate this.

And indeed, he did design and was involved in the first properly
randomized trial that is documented well in the literature.
And led the way for randomization to be used in other clinical trials.
And this was a trial of streptomycin for tuberculosis in 1946.
Interestingly, the use of randomization in this trial was based on
that it was a fair distribution of risk and
benefits to patients in terms of getting the new treatment.
But it was also because this was in the UK right after World War II.
There were very limited supplies of streptomycin.
Mounting a randomized clinical trial was also argued to
be the only way to fairly allocate the limited resources
to, to patients.
Which patients with TB were going to get this new
medicine that had quite a bit of evidence for its efficacy.

### Rationale 
* So as I've talked about, the rationale for randomization is to avoid selection bias and to avoid confounding by indication. That is, that there's some prognostic factors that would be related to treatment assignment, and thereby if they aren't somehow controlled, would bias our assessment of treatment. And it's important to realize that these prognostic factors, such as maybe age or severity of disease or even clinical centers, can influence outcomes as strongly or more strongly as many treatments. Remember that clinical trials are really designed to find small to moderate treatment effects.
If there's very strong treatment effects, many times we don't need a clinical trial.
So these prognostic factors can be quite influential, and so
we use randomization to ensure their balance across the treatment groups.
* And that brings me to the next point, that randomization tends to produce comparable treatment groups on know or unknown confounders. But it's important to note, it's not a guarantee. It's still a probabilistic process, and there are times when you don't get perfect balance. That you may end up with what appears to be an important imbalance in treatment groups. For example, you could end up with many more women in one group than the other. 
* And going back to R A Fisher, the randomization also assures the validity of the statistical test that we use generally to analyze trials. They're based on the idea that the treatment assignment, the primary variable we're looking for and effect in was randomly assigned across the population. 
* And perhaps a less important point but is also a nice feature of randomization is that it gives us a defined time-point for trial entry. We know that we are going to measure events and attribute them to the appropriate treatment group from randomization onward. And so it's a very nice time zero that has some meaning in terms of how the patient was treated as well.


### unequal randomization
I also want to briefly address the issue of using
unequal allocation ratios for randomization.
Pretty much up to now I've been talking or referring
to randomization as sort of two groups one to one allocation.
And that is certainly the most common design for parallel treatment trials.
And one of the reasons the one to
one allocation is so commonly used, it's the most
powerful design.
Other allocation ratios such as two to one
or four to one are typically less powerful.
And I gave you an example here
of the power associated with different allocation ratios.

But there may be reasons that you will compromise on power or alternatively
accept maybe a larger sample size, because you want to use a unequal
allocation ratio.
* It may be important to acquire as much experience as possible with the new treatment including the side effects and toxicity of that treatment. So you may want to have as many people as possible be exposed to the, the new treatment. 
* That also may be an incentive for recruitment. If you're in the situation where patients don't have many options for how they'll be treated, it may be desirable to weight the randomization towards the, the new treatment as a tool for recruiting patients, so that they know that they have a greater chance of getting the new treatment.
* There may also be cost issues depending on how much the treatments cost. Very expensive treatments you, you may have a different allocation ratio in order to conserve resources.
* Also, you can imagine that in some cases that there may be difference in the expected variance of the outcome variable by treatment group. So you may expect that one treatment may
have a more homogeneous effect than another treatment. And therefore you could argue for an unequal allocation ratio to optimize the power if there's a difference in the variance across the groups that's expected. I would say that that's probably an unusual reason for having an unequal allocation ratio.

### selection bias 

And finally, I, I want to speak to the definition
of selection bias. Many of you have heard people talk about selection bias as
a problem in the study group, the entire group selected to be studied.
* That somehow the association between the intervention or the risk factor and the outcome is different in, in the group of people that is studied than in the target population. So the results from the study really aren't generalizable to the target population. So that's sort of an epidemiological definition of selection bias.
* However, in the trial definition of selection bias, we're really talking about eliminating the bias associated with the prognosis of the disease. So again to eliminate the confounding by indication. And we want to, to break that link between what the intervention actually is and the patient's characteristics. So it's more an issue of internal validity when we're talking about, in selection bias, in the context of clinical trials.

## Types of Schemes

I'm going to talk about Simple randomization schemes,
Restricted randomization schemes and Adaptive randomization schemes.
These are, admittedly, somewhat abbreviated overviews
of the various types of randomization schemes
that can be employed in a clinical trial. 

### Simple randomization 
Simple randomization is probably
what most of us are familiar with, it's analogous to the coin toss again.
It's just a complete randomization.
Each time you toss the coin is independent of
the last time you tossed the coin, so it
doesn't matter if you got a heads or tails
the last time, this next flip is totally independent and
has a 50-50 chance of either heads or tails.

The advantage of having a Simple randomization scheme where the last
assignment doesn't tell you anything about the next assignment, and the
actual probability of the treatment assignments stays fixed
from assignment to assignment, from coin toss to coin toss, is that each assignment
is completely unpredictable.
The fact that a patient was assigned to treatment A yesterday will
tell you nothing about what this new patient is going to be assigned to.
And in the long run, if you have enough patients, it will equal out if you have a
truly, scientifically designed randomization process, and you use a
Simple Randomization scheme, the number of patients assigned to each
group should be about equal, assuming you have large enough numbers.

So the risks associated with a Simple
Randomization procedure, is that you may indeed imbalances.
These imbalances could be related to the number of
patients assigned to each treatment group, for example, you could
end up in a trial of 100 patients with 40
assigned to one group and 60 assigned to the other
group, when your ideal was a one to one
allocation with 50 patients in each group, and that
in itself, will lower the statistical power or could
lower the statistical power, associated with your clinical trial.
Also, you can have an imbalance related to important
confounding factors, if there are prognostic factors associated with
the outcome and in a Simple Randomization scheme
the chips are going to fall where they may.
So you could just by chance have more people with severe disease assigned to one
group than than the other, or more women assigned to one group than the other.
So, there's no control on the
characteristics of the patients by treatment group.
And if you have large numbers of patients in a trial,
that's not such a problem because your large numbers
favor the probability that you really will get comparable
distribution of potential confounding factors across the treatment groups.
But with small numbers, you're more likely to run into imbalances.
And again, that can lower the statistical power of your trial.
And even if these imbalance, either in the number of patients, or the types of
patients, or both, don't really affect the results of your trials, they
really are not too severe in terms of numbers, and the factors that they're,
the groups are imbalanced on, really don't have an association with the outcome.
It still can diminish the credibility of your,
results. It can make people questions things.
Well, why, why didn't they have equal numbers in both groups?
Or, more commonly, oh, well, of course they had the sickest patients
were in treatment group A, so that's why treatment group B looked better.
And sometimes you can never really address those credibility issues fully,
and they can really undermine the results of your trial and
give people reasons to not accept the results.
As I referred to before, these risks
are inversely associated with the number of participants.
The more participants you have in a trial, the more that
the properties of probability are going to be working in your favor.
So, how have clinical trialists and biostatisticians addressed this issue?

### Restricted randomization
Well, they've imposed restrictions to the randomization
scheme to ensure balance across important factors in the design of, of experiments.
So, when somehow there's a constraint added to produce the expected
assignment ratio, in the example we've been using, one to one.
According to time that the study's been going on,
or on specified covariates, such as severity of disease,
or gender, or clinic. And the two primary maneuvers that
are used in this restricted randomization are blocking and stratification.
And I'll go over each and one of them separately.

#### Blocking
First we'll start with blocking.
So let me just tell you what blocking is before I tell you why we do it.
A block, if you want to define the block, is a list of treatments that achieves the
treatment assignment ratio.
Again, we're sticking with that example of one to one.
 * So, a block of two would be an A and a B that we achieve their ratio of one to one.
If we use the block size of four, that means that
a block would have two As and two Bs in it.

 * And we talk about permuted blockticides, which means,
every possible way you could list those two As and those two Bs and you see listed
out on the slide is the six possible ways you could order two As and two Bs.
You can have AABB, ABAB, and I'll let you read the rest for yourselves.
But that's the list of permutations of the order
of the treatment assignments inside a block of four,
for a one to one treatment assignment.

 * Another important point is that the size of the smallest possible block
to use, is the sum of the integers defined in the treatment allocation ratio.
So, you can't meet the treatment allocation ratio, if you have a block that
is smaller than the sum of the integers. So, I think an example illustrates
this best.
If the allocation ratio is one to one, the smallest block size is 1 plus 1 is 2.
That's the smallest block you can have, to get a one to one ratio.
So, if you have a different allocation ratio, say two to one, the smallest
possible block size is three because you'd have to have two As and one B.
And, if you wanted to go and
use larger block sizes, the larger block sizes need to be multiples
of the smallest one, so in order to meet the treatment allocation ratio
of two to one, the smallest block size you can have is three.
The next one is six because that is a multiple of the smallest block size
and, it goes up accordingly. So, because within a block size of six,
you could meet that allocation ratio of two to one.
You could have four As and two Bs.
Now if you have a block size of seven that wouldn't work, or even a
block size of eight, you couldn't meet
that treatment allocation ratio within that block size.
So the larger
block size are multiples of the, of the smallest one.
 * And then, when we apply this blocking principle and use
blocks of treatment assignments, what we really do is produce
all possible permutations of the block.
We list all the possible ways a block
of four could be ordered. And then, when we go to develop a randomization scheme or a ran, a list of the treatment assignments, what we do is randomly choose those block sizes.
Randomly choose, from those permutations of a block size of four.
So, I think the example we'll come upon in a few slides will help illustrate this point.
So why do we do this?
 * But the reason we bother to do this is that
it ensures balance in the treatment assignment ratio over time.
And this makes sense, right? Because if we're using that block size of
four, that means after every four patients, even if we have a sample size
of 400, after every four patients, we're ensured that we've met the allocation
ratio, that two have been assigned to A and two to B.
As we go along in the trial, we can't have long
runs of As or long runs of Bs that you might
have in a simple randomization design, that would be associated with
time because it takes time to accrue patients to a trial.
You can't have that problem if you use the block size.
You'll only
have runs of one particular treatment assignment, the
longest run possible within a particular block size, and you can see with a
block size of four and a one to one allocation ratio,
the longest possible run of a treatment is two, for two patients.

#### Combinations
So, how do you figure out how many permuted blocks do
you have with a particular block size? Well, when you start with small block
sizes, it's fairly easy, so, if you have the allocation ratio is one to one, right?
If the size of the block is two, the number of possible blocks you can have is
two, it's AB and BA. And the way you can figure that out is
to write them down, or you can use this multinomial coefficient you see
illustrated at the bottom of the slide in blue with the factorial signs.
Now, don't be scared of, of this formula, it's quite simple.
So again, if you are back to a block size of four with the one to one allocation
ratio, I showed you on the last page and
have listed out all the possible blocks and that
is six.
But, we can come up with that number six by using the multinomial coefficient.
So, the numerator is the factorial of four and you see that 4!,
which translates to 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.
And then the denominator is the number of each kind of
thing, so in this example, in a block size of four,
we're going to have two As and two Bs.
So the R, we have an R1 and an R2, and both of them equal 2 in this case.
So you can see that the 4 factorial is divided by 2 factorial times 2
factorial, and you get the number of possible permuted blocks for a
block size of four is six blocks. And I'll let you go through that on your
own for block size of six, where it starts to get more
complicated and you don't want to have to sit down and write out
all possible blocks, in this case 20, and you'd rather be able to figure
that out more easily using this shortcut of the multinomial coefficient.

#### implementation 
So, once we've decided that we're going to have a blocked randomization design,
commonly referred to as permuted blocks, and this is
probably one of the most common features of a randomized
clinical trial design, that most trials do use blocking,
but there are some considerations when implementing a block design.
 * First you have to use the same allocation ratio, throughout the trial. You can't modify your allocation ratio, as you go along, and we'll see an example of that when we talk about adaptive randomization. So if you're going to use blocking, you've bought into the fact that your allocation ratio is going to be, the same throughout the trial, which again, is very common, not to change the allocation ratio.
 * Second, it's important to understand that block sizes, and information about the block sizes used in a clinical trial are really on a need to know basis. They in general shouldn't be written down in the protocol that the investigators are going to be looking at, because it gives you a hint about how the randomization scheme is going to work. And if you know the block size, then you'll start to be able to predict what the next assignment is. And that's one of the whole points of randomization, is to make the next assignment unpredictable, so investigators or people won't be influenced by that knowledge about who to enroll in the trial, or when to enroll, roll them. So I've heard people say, well, they see the block size written down in the protocol. You really shouldn't write it down there. Now, there should be separate documentation of the treatment assignment scheme and how it was generated, but generally, the details in the protocol should be limited to those that the clinician needs to know in order to execute the protocol, and be knowledgeable about the general experimental design.
 * Now, one of the tricks that we use to maintain that lack of knowledge about upcoming treatment assignments, is to use more than one block size. Because then, the overall sequence of how treatment assignments are allocated is going to appear to be more random.
If you use the standard block size of two in the one to one allocation ratio, people are going to be able to start figuring that out that if, if the first assignment was an A, the next one's going to be a B. And if they know the block size, then they'll know that block's complete and then they're back in the next, when the next block opens up, they're back to not
knowing whether it's going to be an A or a B. But once that third assignment is issued,
they are going to know the fourth assignment. And it gets a little bit more complicated with larger block sizes. But nonetheless, it takes away from the unpredictability aspects of randomization. And so the way that we try to deal with that, is to use more than one block size so that the treatment assignments appear to be more like a simple randomization scheme, and are less likely to be predicted accurately. And this is especially important in unmasked trials. Because, if you know the treatment in a masked trial, and you know which treatment's going to come up, A or B, and it's masked, well, if it's effectively masked, you still don't know that much. You know that it will be a different treatment, but you don't know which treatment it is. If it's a unmasked trial, and you start to figure the block sizes, then you
are going to know the actual treatment that's going to be administered to the next patient, or
have a good idea.  And certainly that opens the door to more selection bias creeping into the trial or again back to that confounding by indication.

Okay, so what are some of the benefits and risks associated with blocking?
 * Well some of the advantages associated with blocking are, that it helps to guarantee overall balance, especially in smaller trials. So, you're more
likely at the end to get equal numbers in both groups.  
 * It also protects against time related
changes that may influence your clinical trial that could be, those changes could be in the composition of the study population. So if you start with more severe patients and get to less severe patients enrolled in the trial as the trial goes on, if you have blocking, you're more likely to have equal representation of those different types of patients in both groups.
And those kind of changes, you know, a lot of things can change over the course of a trial.
The study population, you may have some new data collection procedures or new instrumentation that is used, implemented in the course of the trial that you'd like to have used equally in both groups. And there could be other forces, outside of the trial, that may influence outcomes that you would like those external forces to be equally distributed across the treatment groups. And by insuring that the allocation ratio is met as you go along in the trial, blocking protects against some of these time related changes. 
  * Also, if you have a case where a trial is stopped early, either because of efficacy measures, you've found that a good treatment and you don't believe it's ethical to continue. Or safety reasons that you're more likely to have balance groups because you have this blocking that institutes balance every so often as you go along, and that leads to a more powerful analyses.

The disadvantages of blocking, as I mentioned before, is that they can facilitate the prediction of future assignments. If you figure out the block size, you can start to figure out what is likely to be the next assignment. And that disadvantage is more problematic in unmasked trials, or trials that are poorly masked, that people can figure out the treatment assignments.

### Stratification
So now I'm going to go on to
the second common maneuver that's used
to restrict randomization, and that is stratification.
  * And stratification is used to ensure balance in the treatment groups across groups that can be specified before randomization. So by imposing stratification, we can ensure that the treatment assignment is met within a subgroup of the population and those subgroups are commonly clinic, gender, or some measure of disease severity. So, if we stratify by clinic, then we can ensure that at each clinic we are going to meet the allocation ratio. And you can imagine that could seem like intuitively an important thing to do. That if you have clinics scattered across the country or indeed the world, that there may be plenty of population infrastructure issues that influence the outcome for those patients just as much as a treatment may. So you want to ensure that you're balanced in your treatment assignment within each clinic, so that you have a fair comparison of the treatment assignments. And those external factors associate with the clinic don't bias comparison. 
  * Generally, if you're going to use stratification, it should be reserved for subgrouping variables that are considered to be strongly related to the outcome, the primary outcome for the trial. They can either be a strong confounder, sort of, as we've talked about before, that some prognostic factor that strongly predicts whether you're going to
have a good or a bad outcome, or some factor that is actually even an effect modifier that the treatment effect works differently in different subgroups of the population. 
  * So practically, what stratification requires is a separate treatment assignment schedule for each stratum in a Stratified Randomization scheme. So if you have three clinics, that really means, if you're going to institute a randomization scheme that's stratified by clinic, that you'll need three different treatment assignment lists.

So here's an example of both stratification and blocking.
So the example we're going to use here is for some type of treatment for breast cancer.
So we have treatment A or B. Again, back to the one to one treatment allocation ratio, that's what our ideal is. And we're going to stratify it by two different factors. One is center, is the patient coming to Center X or Center Y? We have two different centers. And then we're also going to stratify the treatment assignment based on the patient's postmenopausal status. Is this someone who has gone through menopause or premonopausal person? Into this stratified design, we're going to institute a block size of four. So, if you look at the table, you can see that the first row indicates the center and then, that sort of divides the actual table in half. Within each center, you can have postmenopausal or premenopausal women. So, within each center, you have two types of women. So, what's the treatment assignment gong to be?
Well, if you look under clinic X for postmenopausal women, if we are using a block size four, potential first block could be the one listed there with the patient gets assignment B, the second patient assignment A, the third patient assignment B, and then the fourth patient assignment A. And as I talked about before when we were discussing blocking, walah, you end up with two As and two Bs after four patients. But notice that, that's specifically
within Center X within postmenopausal women. 
So you actually have a separate list based on the stratification variables. So, again, if you go to the right one column, we've got the list for premenopausal women who enrolled at Center ,
and when a premenopausal woman arrives at Center X to be randomized, she is going to receive an assignment from that second string of As and Bs. So the first woman who fits that  characteristic is going to get assignment B, the second woman will get assignment B and the third and fourth women will get assignment A, because that is the, the first block in that
particular treatment assignment list for that combination of stratification variables.


Now one point that may be a little hard to absorb at first, is that if you
stratify without blocking, there's really no point in stratifying.
Because, what you end up doing is segmenting your
population into small groups. And then, imposing a Simple Randomization scheme within those segmented groups. So, you could even be more at risk for imbalances within those groups because you have smaller numbers of patients. So it's important to recognize that stratification alone is not a useful maneuver unless you're going to add blocking to ensure that there is balance over time and over assignments within each list that's defined by the stratification variables.

#### pratical aspects
So, I'm going to go on to discuss some of the practical aspects of stratification.
  * One thing that you should recognize is that you have to limit it to a few variables.
Once people are kind of aware of the benefits of stratification, they tend to think, wouldn't it be nice to have very homogeneous groups? But that can get you into problems, to have too many stratification variables. So, you want to pick ones that are highly related to outcomes.
That are really important to control for and sort of a sense of confounding, and
also ones that are logistically possible. You have to know the stratification variable status before you randomize. So, you probably don't want to have as a stratification variable some interpretation of a blood test that takes a few days or a few weeks to get the results back, because you can't randomize someone until you know which list to use. So there's a logistical consideration that you need to have those data available at randomization. 

The typical ones that are used in **multicenter clinical trials** or clinic, that almost universally considered an, an important stratification variable, because populations and treatments do tend to vary quite widely by center. Sometimes in a **surgical trial**, because there's concern about the effect of different skill levels, the stratification variable will actually be on the surgeon, involved in the trial, so that you can ensure, that there is
an equal allocation of what procedures were done by surgeon. You may also stratify by **stage of disease** if that is an important prognostic factor, if you have some measure of disease
severity and what's the likely prognosis that you think is strongly related
to the outcome, then you may consider that as a stratification variable.
Probably there's more emphasis than there should
be on **demographic characteristics** as stratification variables.
But if you thought that it was important to ensure that you had the same
numbers of people in treatment A and treatment B within
subgroups based by gender or race or age categories.
You could also stratify based on that type of characteristic.
The problem that you can come across with having too
many stratification variables, as you saw on the last slide,
each combination relates in a separate list, is that you get too
many strata. And you can't fill up the blocks, and you
actually are working against yourself because if you have lots of strata.
And each one has a separate list associated with it, and
people are coming into the trial and filling up those blocks what
you'll, you may end up with is a lot
of open blocks, blocks that didn't get completely filled.
So a block size of four would be open
if only three assignments were filled in that block.
And if you have to merge together data from a lot of unopened blocks, you're
likely to end up with an imbalance overall in the treatment group allocation.
So, you've sort of shot yourself in the foot.
So, stratification and blocking are really
the two most common restrictive randomization features.
And so, the take home points here are that blocking is very important in terms
of ensuring that you maintain the design allocation
ratio as you go throughout the trail and
helps control for a number of things that can change over time.
Whereas stratification, is related to baseline characteristics of the
patient, or where the patient is at, that you
can control the balance of the treatment assignment, that
it meets the design assignment within those subgroups of patients.
And indeed, for stratification to be effective, you should also
apply blocking.

## Adaptative scheme
So the final type of scheme I'm
going to talk about is an Adaptive Randomization scheme.
And I'm only going to briefly review this.
An Adaptive scheme is a process in which
the probability of assignment to the treatment i.e the
allocation ratio, does not remain constant over the
course of the trial, but is somehow determined by
the current balance of participants in the trial, or
even the outcomes from patients enrolled in the trial.
There are two common types of Adaptive Randomization schemes.
  * One is based on minimization, after the first patient the
treatment assignment that yields the smallest in balance is chosen.
So, instead of having stratum to
ensure balance across important characteristics, in a minimization scheme
you can be balancing on a number of characteristics or
prognostic factors as you go on in the trial, and
ensure that your, have balance as the trial goes on.
So then, if you have a patient with a certain set of
characteristics, that you have a relative lack of in a certain treatment group,
their probability to be assigned to that treatment group would be
greater, and you can combine several patient characteristics to do this.
But the allocation scheme can't be determined in advance
if you're using a minimization design, so you have
to have some, you know, real time usually computer
resources to be able to effectively institute a minimization scheme.
In effect, you're sort of writing or generating the treatment assignment list as
you go along to ensure balance, across the treatment groups.
Again, you have to decide what factors you want
to balance things on, and have data on those factors.
  * Another type of Adaptive Randomization that relies more on outcome assessment,
is a play the winner design, where you change the treatment allocation to favor
the better treatment based on the primary outcome.
So, if one treatment appears more favorable,
you preferentially assign patients to the betterment treatment.
You give them a greater probability of assigned to the better treatment.
To do this, you have to be able to evaluate outcomes relatively quickly.
So for the prior patient's outcomes to influence this next
patient's treatment assignment, you have to have
those data again to implement this kind
of design, and therefore, need to be
able to evaluate the outcomes relatively, quickly, and
you can implement these designs in stages,
so you might start with a, fixed allocation
ratio and after you get to a
certain number of patients, impliment an adaptive ratio.

# Masking 


The purpose of masking is to reduce information bias.
In a nutshell, it helps to ensure that we treat participants assigned to the
experimental and control treatments the same throughout
the trial and objectively evaluate their outcomes.

  * First masking is synonymous with the term blinding which you may be
more familiar with that is used in clinical trials to blind treatment.
But, for various reasons, I think
masking is really a better term.
  * What masking means is that the
treatment assignment is not known after randomization.
And so it's important to recognize that this isn't
about not knowing the treatment assignment before someone comes in.
But it's after randomization.
So, if someone's assigned a treatment, but it's
mass, so they don't know which treatment it is.
And that someone who doesn't know can be the patient.
It can be the patient and the clinical personnel.
Or include people who are evaluating outcomes in patients.
It can include data processors, analysts, and
even the independent review committee and sponsors.
And so we talk about single, double, triple and quadruple masking,
and I'll go over specific definitions of those in a few slides.
  * But I do want to emphasize again, this is not the same as
the concealment of treatment assignment prior to randomization.
That's what kind of design maneuver we used to prevent selection bias.
So you can still have that early concealment in an unmasked trial, that
once the person's assigned to the treatment,
everybody knows what treatment that person's on.
So that's a different thing than masking, which is once they're in the trial.
So it's sort of an extension
of that protection.
And I'll try to elaborate on that in the next few slides.


So what's the rational for keeping people unaware of
the treatment assignment during the trial is to reduce
any bias that might be related to prior knowledge
or beliefs about the treatment effects on the performance trial.
Not who gets into the trial and who gets assigned to which group.
But once they're in the trial that everyone
gets followed in the same manner.
 * So it promotes objectivity in the data reporting.
So when people are doing ad-hoc reports about whether
they've had an adverse event or those types of things
that come to you sort of unscheduled will be unbiased
or if people don't actually know what treatment they're on.
So, if they don't know that they're
on the aspirin treatment maybe they're not as
likely to go ahead and report Gastric distress.
  * Also it promotes objectivity in the data collection and follow-up.
So that the study schedule is maintained in all treatment groups To the same degree
and not somewhat influenced by knowing what treatment assignment people are on.
You might think oh, they're on the new treatment so
you better get them in more often and make sure they
don't miss visits.
So if we masked the treatments people shouldn't be influenced by that.
  * Also on the other treatments people may be recieving and the
test they recieve during the trial And even their own individual behaviors.
If we mask the treatments, we're more likely to have those
kind of external forces outside of the trial be the same.
Because you can imagine someone who's about to enroll in a clinical
trial may be more energized to change other
factors in their life that would affect their treatment.
Like if you were going to enroll in a trial of
hypertension, well you might decide to make some dietary modifications, because
now, you know, you're more knowledgeable about hypertension and the
staff has gotten you educated on the things you can do.
And if you were randomized to the Placebo or the control group,
let's say if it was unmasked so it's
just a control group, you're going to be on observation.
You might still be energized to change your lifestyle some.
  * It also promotes objectivity in outcome assessment and in data interpretation.
And by data interpretation, I'm meaning data interpretation
as we go through the trial and monitor it.
Certainly at the end of the trial we're
going to want to know what the treatment assignments are.

So what are the levels of masking?
Well there can be many but I'm going to just go over these three.
 * Normally when we're talking about a single
mask trial, we're talking about a trial where
the participant is masked to the treatment
but everyone else knows what the treatment is.
 * In a double mask trial, it's usually the
participant and the clinical investigators are masked to treatment.
So, the people administering the treatment, and
perhaps the same ones who are evaluating the
participant's outcomes are also masked.
 * In a triple masked trial, that can mean that the participant
and the clinical investigator and others are masked to the trial.
And those others might be independent people who evaluate outcomes.
Let's say if there are some sort of x-rays or MRI's
that need to be evaluated, that those people are also masked.
Or the data analysts are masked.
So, they just know
that there's treatment group a and there's treatment
group b, but they don't know which is which.
Or the data monitoring committee, or the sponsers.

So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of masking?
So, that we're protecting against performance and reporting bias.
But, what are the disadvantages?
Why wouldn't we do this if it's a
good tool to help us have more objective results?
Well, the disadvantages
include, that it may be logistically or ethically impossible to do the masking.
It also may not reflect the clinical care practices as well.
Or the real world clinical conditions where people know what treatments
they're on, and their healthcare providers know what treatments they're on.
That may not be as real world scenario.
And it certainly
increases the logistical complexity of mounting
a trial and getting the treatments together.
And with that increased complexity, you can
imagine that also goes along with increased cost.

So, I just want to go over how the level of
masking is related to the bias protection we get from masking.
So if we don't have any masking, we do have the potential
for bias in all of those areas that are listed as rows.
Data reporting, collection follow up, and so on.
 * Now, if we have a single masked trial
where the participants mask, well, we have some protection
against data reporting bias that patients are not, maybe, more likely to
report specific adverse events, if they don't know what treatment they're on.
But, again, maybe not any protection for data collection and follow up.
We may be able to protect somewhat
against differential behaviors in the treatment groups.
But all the other concomitant things that
go along with healthcare would not be masked.
  * And you can see
once we jump up to double masking, we get
a lot more protection from masking, because we are actually
not only masking the participant, but we're masking the people
who are actually conducting the trial and evaluating the outcomes.
So there's a big gain from going from single masking to double masking.
  * And triple masking is again when we have other
people who are involved in the data analysis and
interpretation masked to the trial as we go on.
And that's a little bit controversial whether
it's really good to have everybody masked
in a clinical trial where your giving
people drugs and you're following their health outcomes.
You know, somebody's gotta know what's going
on to protect the participants against undue risks.

So, how do we decide whether we're going to mask treatments in a clinical trial?
I've certainly been involved in a number of trials that are unmasked trials, and I
still think that they were good trials
that added to the scientific evidence about treatment.
  * But the first decision point is whether it's ethical to mask a trial.
Is masking the trial going to expose participants to
risks by giving them some sort of placebo treatment,
a sham surgery, or an IV infusion?
In some cases, those may be appropriate and okay but you have to think about that.
And in most cases sham surgery is probably not considered appropriate.
Also even if there isn't a risk associated
with giving the person a sham or placebo treatment.
The risk to the participant could be increased because
the investigator and caregivers don't know the treatment.
And they may need to know the treatment to really
appropriately ensure that the patient is protected against undue risk.
So maybe because of the monitoring for the adverse events.
So in that case it would be difficult to mask.
And you'll also have to have a viable
unmasking plan if you're going to put people
in an experimental situation, and not only
you're randomizing them the treatment, you're not
telling the tre, treatment to the participants
and the care providers and the clinical personnel.
You've gotta have a viable plan to unmask the treatment
that is kind of commiserate or with the risk involved.

 * So the next thing you have to think about, is it possible to mask the treatment?
Is the treatment has such distinctive
characteristics that it's just impossible to mask.
One treatment that's difficult to mask is zinc
supplementation because there's a very characteristic flavor with zinc.
And then behavioral interventions, like weight loss
programs and education programs, you just cannot mask.
It just wouldn't work.
And also maybe some community interventions.
So if you're doing interventions based on at
the community level, it may also be impossible to mask.
And then in terms of whats possible can you make treatments that seem identical?
So this is kind of related to
the does the treatment have distinctive characteristics?
Can you make a placebo treatment that is, looks exactly like the active treatment?
Or in the case when you may be comparing
two active treatments can you create a placebo for each
treatment so that you have a dummy treatment.
So patients who are randomized to either one active treatment
versus another will actually take two doses of medication maybe.
They'll take the active treatment and then the dummy for
the other treatment because you couldn't them to look exactly alike.
  * Also influencing whether you decide to mask is the
type of outcome you have chosen for you trial.
What are the primary outcomes?
If they're very objective outcomes it's probably less important to mask.
Certainly the most objective outcome is whether a participant alive or dead.
And then, in that situation it's not as likely to be influenced
by people's opinions about the treatment.
So the more the subjective the outcome, the more
you should be thinking about trying to mask the treatment.
So if you're asking for patients evaluation of how they
feel, certainly in pain studies, it's very important to mask.
But sometimes, even when the outcome can be fairly subjective
you may not need to mask, or you can maybe institute
some bias control without masking the participants
by masking the people that evaluate the outcome.
So the people that are looking at the X-rays
or the MRIs don't know the, the treatment assignment.
So they won't be influenced.
I've done a lot of ophthalmology studies where we're taken different images of the
eye, the retina, and we haven't been able to mask a number of those studies
because of the invasiveness and the different modes of treatments.
You know, in some cases we had surgery where we put medicine in peoples eyes.
But even though we weren't able to mask the treatment
at the level the participant or the clinical investigator applying the
treatment, we were able to mask the reading center that
looked at the images and evaluated how the treatment was doing.
  * So it's also another thing to think about
is, what's the comparison group?
Is it a no treatment observation, or an active control?
If you're giving someone an active treatment, you
create some expectation about that this will help them.
So, it may be less important if you're comparing two active treatments
to mask than if you're comparing an active treatment to no treatment.
Because, in the no treatment
group, people know they're not getting treatment and there's some meaning
to just getting treatment that may help people have better outcomes.
 * Certainly you have to think about whether it's feasible.
What's the cost of masking?
What's the benefit?
Are you going to be able to do it effectively
enough to be worth the cost and is it practical?
Sometimes you're requiring participants to take
multiple doses of medication, in these kind
of double dummy designs.
And so, are participants going to adhere to it?
You know, it's hard enough to get people to take
a pill each day, much less have them take four.
And you really have to think about the practicality of it.
 

So, as I said in considering the ethics of masking, you
have to have a unmasking plan, if you do mask a trial.
And there's two types of unmasking
that comes up. 
 * There's the unmasking that's planned.
When the participant has completed the trial you certainly
want to let them know what treatment they were on.
Especially if they may want to continue with that
treatment if they felt that they were doing well.
And the strategy depends on the close out design.
So you can have a common close out design when you may enroll
patients over a period of time, but you're going to follow
everybody to a common closeout within, let's say, a month.
So, people may have different amounts of follow up time, depending on when they
were enrolled in the trial, but the
trial's going to end in November of 2010 regardless.
So, at that, you can sort of plan to
shut down all operations in terms of actively following people.
And you can have a close-out
visit and sort of inform everyone, around the same time.
But more commonly we have anniversary close out.
Where participants enroll in a trial and are followed for
a specific length of lime, let's say for six months.
So, you may be enrolling for a trial over a few
years, but than each participant is only followed for six months.
So you have people finishing the trial as you're continued to enroll.
So that's a little more difficult.
Because you don't want to be revealing the treatment assignment
to the clinic staff in a double mask trial.
But you do have an obligation to reveal it to the participant.
So things we've used is letters to participants at the exit interview
that we also have a letter that goes to their study physician in.
Of the asthma trials I've been involved in, and with
instructions on how to continue the treatment if they were
pleased with it.
Also in terms of unmasking, you should plan to find out information on what the
participant and the clinical personnel thought the
treatment assignment was before you can reveal it.
It can be informative about how effective your masking regimen was.
And it's important that you document the procedure.
And that you provide the participant and
their primary care providers with as much information, as you can about their status at the end of the trial.
It may be things like giving them the
results of tests that were done during the trial.
  * But then you can also have unplanned unmasking
and that's when a participant is going along in
a trial and some event happens that there's
a need to know what that participant is on.
You can commonly, you would think of it as being an adverse event.
Well, the first thing is, that we discourage that.
We really don't want to reveal treatment assignments.
And most of the time, if someone has an adverse
event, you're going to stop the drug regardless of whatever else has happened.
So, the treatment is going to be to stop the drug, and see if
the adverse event goes away, and you don't really need to unmask people for that.
But there can be extenuating circumstances,
especially if all the treatments are approved.
Well you may need to know what the patient did
poorly on to decide what the next treatment should be.
And certainly in cases of overdoses where there may be real safety concerns.
And then you might need to know exactly what the
treatment is if the two year old has gotten the
bottled opened and downed 12 pills you want to know
the difference between the sugar pills and the active substance.
And so you want to have easy access that is
appropriate to the level of risk associated with the treatments
without being too easy.
So methods we've used are if it's a lot of concern about people being able to
know immediately, you could actually have the unmasking on the study drug container.
Something that they could pull off to reveal what's inside the
bottle and that would seem to work for most overdose situations.
You'd hope the bottle would be near the two year old.
You could have people at the clinics who are semi independent and
from the trial and be responsible for it.
You can contact the parties that are doing the randomization schedule.
So you have some sort of 24 hour call line,
or a website to be able to reveal the treatment assignment.
And we have used all of those.
And the best thing has been to discourage it.
There have been very few cases where we've really had to unmask people.
